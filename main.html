	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>
     My motivation to become a software developer stems from a deep curiosity about how technology shapes our world and a desire to create solutions that make life easier for others. I enjoy problem-solving, learning new skills, and collaborating with others to build innovative applications. The ever-evolving nature of software development excites me, and I am driven by the opportunity to continuously grow and contribute to meaningful projects.
